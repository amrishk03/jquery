In this screencast I cover the absolute bare minimum setup for utilizing jQuery on a “real” website. We have an index.html file with the basic HTML5 structure stubbed out. jQuery is included as a <script> and then we perform a super simple jQuery task. The entire file looks like this:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Learning jQuery</title>
</head>
<body>
  
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

  <script src="js/jquery-2.0.3.js"></script>
  <script>
    $("h1").css("color", "red");
  </script>

</body>
</html>
I wanted to cover that right away so that you can experience how easy using jQuery can be. And also because we’ll be using CodePen for a lot of live coding for the rest of the series. CodePen just gives us a testing / demonstration environment that is easy to work with and great for screencasts. What it is doing behind the scenes is essentially the same as what we just did here. I wanted that to be understood – so you don’t think using CodePen is some strange/magical place that is different from how you would write code.

The same exact thing as we did with the index.html file is like this on CodePen:
